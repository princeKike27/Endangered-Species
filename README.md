# Endangered Species in US National Parks

For this project I analyzed data from the US National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. Taking the role of a biodiversity analyst, the goal is to ensure the survival of at-risk species to maintain the level of biodiversity within the parks. In that sense, I will identify if there are any patterns in the types of species that become endangered and their relationship to the National Parks.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

- Data cleaning and standardization.
- Distribution of observations by park.
- Count of observation status by category.
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which animal is the most common and what is its distribution amongst the parks?
